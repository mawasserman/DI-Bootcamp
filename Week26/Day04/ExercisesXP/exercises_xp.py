# # 🌟 Exercise 1 : Temperature Advice
# # Instructions
# # Create a function called get_random_temp().
# # This function should return an integer between -10 and 40 degrees (Celsius), selected at random.
# # Test your function to make sure it generates expected results.
# # import random

# # def get_random_temp():  #first time doing this function...
# #     return random.randint(-10, 40)
# # print(get_random_temp())

# import random

# def get_random_temp(season):
#     if season == "winter":
#         return random.uniform(-10, 16)
#     elif season == "spring":
#         return random.uniform(0, 25)
#     elif season == "summer":
#         return random.uniform(20, 40)

#     else:
#         print("That's not a valid season. Please enter winter, spring, summer, or autumn.")
#         return None

# # Create a function called main().
# # Inside this function, call get_random_temp() to get a temperature, and store its value in a variable.
# # Inform the user of the temperature in a friendly message, eg. “The temperature right now is 32 degrees Celsius.”
# # Let’s add more functionality to the main() function. Write some friendly advice relating to the temperature:
# # below zero (eg. “Brrr, that’s freezing! Wear some extra layers today”)
# # between zero and 16 (eg. “Quite chilly! Don’t forget your coat”)
# # between 16 and 23
# # between 24 and 32
# # between 32 and 40

# def main():
#     season = input("What season is it? ").lower().strip()
#     temp = get_random_temp(season)
#     if temp is None:  
#         print("Unable to determine temperature due to invalid input.")
#         return
#     temp = round(temp, 2)
#     print(f"The temperature right now is {temp} degrees Celsius.")
#     if temp < 0:
#         print("Brrr, that’s freezing! Wear some extra layers today")
#     elif temp >= 0 and temp < 16:
#         print("Quite chilly! Don’t forget your coat")
#     elif temp >= 16 and temp < 24:
#         print("Still pretty cold for Brazilians... Sleep with thousands of blankets!")
#     elif temp >= 24 and temp < 32:
#         print("Regular winter in Rio de Janeiro! Get a jacket!")
#     elif temp >= 32 and temp <= 40:
#         print("If you are in Rio de Janeiro, thank HaShem that is not summer yet!")
#     else:
#         return None

# main()

# # Change the get_random_temp() function:
# # Add a parameter to the function, named ‘season’.
# # Inside the function, instead of simply generating a random number between -10 and 40, set lower and upper limits based on the season, eg. if season is ‘winter’, temperatures should only fall between -10 and 16.
# # Now that we’ve changed get_random_temp(), let’s change the main() function:
# # Before calling get_random_temp(), we will need to decide on a season, so that we can call the function correctly. Ask the user to type in a season - ‘summer’, ‘autumn’ (you can use ‘fall’ if you prefer), ‘winter’, or ‘spring’.
# # Use the season as an argument when calling get_random_temp().

# # Bonus: Give the temperature as a floating-point number instead of an integer.
# # Bonus: Instead of asking for the season, ask the user for the number of the month (1 = January, 12 = December). Determine the season according to the month.

# # Exercise 3 : When will I retire ?
# # Instructions
# # The point of the exercise is to check if a person can retire depending on their age and their gender.
# # Note : Let’s say retirement age is 67 for men, and 62 for women (born after April, 1947).

# # Create a function get_age(year, month, day)
# # Hard-code the current year and month in your code (there are better ways of doing this, but for now it will be enough.)
# # After calculating the age of a person, the function should return the age (the age is an integer).
# # Create a function can_retire(gender, date_of_birth).
# # It should call the get_age function (with what arguments?) in order to receive an age.
# # Now it has all the information it needs in order to determine if the person with the given gender and date of birth is able to retire or not.
# # Calculate. You may need to do a little more hard-coding here.
# # Return True if the person can retire, and False if he/she can’t.

# # Some Hints
# # Ask for the user’s gender as “m” or “f”.
# # Ask for the user’s date of birth in the form of “yyyy/mm/dd”, eg. “1993/09/21”.
# # Call can_retire to get a definite value for whether the person can or can’t retire.
# # Display a message informing the user whether they can retire or not.
# # As always, test your code to ensure it works.

# def get_age():
#     date_today = input("Please enter today's date in the format yyyy/mm/dd: ").split("/")
#     gender = input("Please enter your gender (m/f): ").lower().strip()
#     date_birth = input("Please enter your birthdate in the format yyyy/mm/dd: ").split("/")
    
#     age = int(date_today[0]) - int(date_birth[0])
#     if int(date_today[1]) < int(date_birth[1]) or (int(date_today[1]) == int(date_birth[1]) and int(date_today[2]) < int(date_birth[2])):
#         age -= 1
    
#     if gender == "m" and age >= 67:
#         print(f"You are {age}, so you can retire.")
#     elif gender == "f" and age >= 62:
#         print(f"You are {age}, so you can retire.")
#     else:
#         print(f"You are {age}, so you can NOT retire. Work slave!")

# get_age()
    

# Exercise 4:
# Instructions
# Write a function that accepts one parameter (an int: X) and returns the value of X+XX+XXX+XXXX.
# Example:

# If X=3, the output when calling our function should be 3702 (3 + 33 + 333 + 3333)

# Hint: treating our number as a int or a str at different points in our code may be helpful
x = input("Enter an integer X: ")

def weird_sum(x):
    list_x = []

    for i in range(1, 5):
        list_x.append(x * i)
        # print(list_x)
    
    sum_x = sum([int(i) for i in list_x])
    print(sum_x)

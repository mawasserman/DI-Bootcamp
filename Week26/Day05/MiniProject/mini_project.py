# Create a TicTacToe game in python, where two users can play together.

# Instructions
# The game is played on a grid that’s 3 squares by 3 squares.
# Players take turns putting their marks (O or X) in empty squares.
# The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
# When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.


# Hint
# To do this project, you basically need to create four functions:

# display_board() – To display the Tic Tac Toe board (GUI).
display_board()


# player_input(player) – To get the position from the player.
player_input(player)


# check_win() – To check whether there is a winner or not.
check_win()


# play() – The main function, which calls all the functions created above.
play()


# Note: The 4 functions above are just an example. You can implement many more helper functions or choose a completely different appoach if you want.



# Tips : Consider the following:
# What functionality will need to accur every turn to make this program work?
# After contemplating the question above, think about splitting your code into smaller pieces (functions).
# Remember to follow the single responsibility principle! each function should do one thing and do it well!

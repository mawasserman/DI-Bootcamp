# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1: Currencies
# Instructions
# class Currency:
#     def __init__(self, currency, amount):
#         self.currency = currency
#         self.amount = amount

#     #Your code starts HERE


# Using the code above, implement the relevant methods and dunder methods which will output the results below.
# Hint : When adding 2 currencies which donâ€™t share the same label you should raise an error.
# >>> c1 = Currency('dollar', 5)
# >>> c2 = Currency('dollar', 10)
# >>> c3 = Currency('shekel', 1)
# >>> c4 = Currency('shekel', 10)

# >>> str(c1)
# '5 dollars'

# >>> int(c1)
# 5

# >>> repr(c1)
# '5 dollars'

# >>> c1 + 5
# 10

# >>> c1 + c2
# 15

# >>> c1 
# 5 dollars

# >>> c1 += 5
# >>> c1
# 10 dollars

# >>> c1 += c2
# >>> c1
# 20 dollars

# >>> c1 + c3
# TypeError: Cannot add between Currency type <dollar> and <shekel>


# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2: Import
# Instructions
# In a file named func.py create a function that sum 2 numbers, and prints the result
# In a file named exercise_one.py import the function and call it to print the result
# Hint: You can use the the following syntaxes:

# import module_name 

# OR 

# from module_name import function_name 

# OR 

# from module_name import function_name as fn 

# OR

# import module_name as mn


# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 3: String module

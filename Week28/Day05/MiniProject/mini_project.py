# ðŸŒŸ Anagram checker
# We will create a program that will ask the user for a word.
# It will check if the word is a valid English word, and then find all possible anagrams for that word.



# Instructions
# Create a new file called anagram_checker.py which contains a class called AnagramChecker.


# Now create another Python file, called anagrams.py. This will contain all the UI (user interface) functionality of your program, and will rely on AnagramChecker for the anagram-related logic.
